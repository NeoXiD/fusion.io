fusion.io is fast and lightweight plugin system for Node.js applications. This module
follows the philosophy *everything's a plugin™*, which effectively means that your whole
application is just built on top of a bunch of plugins. They can interact and rely on each other,
without worrying about dependency resolving & injection.
